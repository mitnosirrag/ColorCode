ColorCode
=========

Simple utility for sorting files and folders based on OSX Finder colors.

##History

I was looking to get in to Mac/iOS development a few years ago, but always need a real project to actually learn from.
My brother told me he always wanted to be able to color code files on his desktop and have them be automatically 
organized at the click of a button.
